# Automatic assignment handler for Mlucas using manual testing forms at mersenne.org

# EWM: adapted from https://github.com/MarkRose/primetools/blob/master/mfloop.py by teknohog and Mark Rose, with help rom Gord Palameta.

# This only handles LL testing (first-time and double-check) for now.
# To-do: Add support for PRP-testing.

# This version can run in parallel with Mlucas, as it uses lockfiles to avoid conflicts when updating files.

# Good refs re. Python regexp: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pattern-matching-python-regex/, https://www.python-course.eu/re.php
# pre-v19 only handled LL-test assignments starting with either DoubleCheck or Test, followed by =, and ending with 3 ,number pairs:
#
#	workpattern = r"(DoubleCheck|Test)=.*(,[0-9]+){3}"
#
# v19 we add PRP-test support - both first-time and DC of these start with PRP=, the DCs tack on 2 more ,number pairs representing
# the PRP base to use and the PRP test-tyoe (the latter is a bit complex to explain here). Sample of the 4 worktypes supported by v19:
#
#	Test=7A30B8B6C0FC79C534A271D9561F7DCC,89459323,76,1
#	DoubleCheck=92458E009609BD9E10577F83C2E9639C,50549549,73,1
#	PRP=BC914675C81023F252E92CF034BEFF6C,1,2,96364649,-1,76,0
#	PRP=51D650F0A3566D6C256B1679C178163E,1,2,81348457,-1,75,0,3,1
#
# and the obvious regexp pattern-modification is
#
#	workpattern = r"(DoubleCheck|Test|PRP)=.*(,[0-9]+){3}"
#
# Here is where we get to the kind of complication the late baseball-philosopher Yogi Berra captured via his aphorism,
# "In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they're different". Namely, while the above regexp pattern
# should work on all 4 assignment patterns, since each has a string of at least 3 comma-separated nonnegative ints somewhere
# between the 32-hexchar assignment ID and end of the line, said pattern failed on the 3rd of the above 4 assignments,
# apparently because when the regexp is done via the 'greplike' below, the (,[0-9]+){3} part of the pattern gets implicitly
# tiled to the end of the input line. Assignment # 3 above happens to have a negative number among the final 3, thus the
# grep fails. This weird behavior is not reproducible running Python in console mode:
#
#	>>> import re
#	>>> s1 = "DoubleCheck=92458E009609BD9E10577F83C2E9639C,50549549,73,1"
#	>>> s2 = "Test=7A30B8B6C0FC79C534A271D9561F7DCC,89459323,76,1"
#	>>> s3 = "PRP=BC914675C81023F252E92CF034BEFF6C,1,2,96364649,-1,76,0"
#	>>> s4 = "PRP=51D650F0A3566D6C256B1679C178163E,1,2,81348457,-1,75,0,3,1"
#	>>> print re.search(r"(DoubleCheck|Test|PRP)=.*(,[0-9]+){3}" , s1)
#	<_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x1004bd250>
#	>>> print re.search(r"(DoubleCheck|Test|PRP)=.*(,[0-9]+){3}" , s2)
#	<_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x1004bd250>
#	>>> print re.search(r"(DoubleCheck|Test|PRP)=.*(,[0-9]+){3}" , s3)
#	<_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x1004bd250>
#	>>> print re.search(r"(DoubleCheck|Test|PRP)=.*(,[0-9]+){3}" , s4)
#	<_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x1004bd250>
#
# Anyhow, based on that I modified the grep pattern to work around the weirdness, by appending .* to the pattern, thus
# changing things to "look for 3 comma-separated nonnegative ints somewhere in the assignment, followed by anything",
# also now to specifically look for a 32-hexchar assignment ID preceding such a triplet, and to allow whitespace around
# the =. The latter bit is not  needed based on current server assignment format, just a personal aesthetic bias of mine:
#
workpattern = r"(DoubleCheck|Test|PRP)\s*=\s*([0-9A-F]){32}(,[0-9]+){3}.*"
